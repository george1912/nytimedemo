## Objective:
The purpose of this exercise to to demonstrate my knowledge of:
1. streamlining email development 
2. using modern webframe works and tools 
3. show modular design
4. personalization using data

##References:
For this project I wanted to take two completly different emails and see if I could meld them togethe in on project to reflect the experience of what having to work in an email project and landing page project at the same time. I got the emails from [Reallygoodemails](https://reallygoodemails.com/)
1.[Year in Review](https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/elementor-2019-year-in-review-our-journey-together-magazine-27/)
2.[The Weekly](https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/how-illegally-mined-colombian-gold-could-end-up-in-your-smartphone/live/)

###Methods:
1. used _jekyll_** framework to templatize the content
2. used _layouts_** to create a default wrapper for each unique page that could be reused for future pages
3. used _includes_** to create content blocks to be used in the emails
4. used _data_** to load a csv file and then call that data in content blocks with _includes_**
5. split the styles into components within the _sass_** folder
6. used _mixins_ to create a unique dark mode theme

##future improvements:
1. test emails with client testing tool like Emails on Acid
2. streamline media queries using mixins
3. streamline sass further to create more components


##Hope you enjoyed checking this out!
